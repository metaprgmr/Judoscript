<p><b>Abstract</b> &nbsp;

Load testing is to collect performance data of a web service under
stress situations. It is carried out by issuing a large number of
requests in a short period of time against the target web site, and
collect statistics such as site response time. <em>JudoScript</em> supports versatile
HTTP client and server programming as well as HTML scraping and
XML scripting. It can be used to launch effective load tests, check
the server responses and record useful data.

<p>
<img src="../share/oe_L.gif" align=left valign=top border=0 alt="L">oad testing reveals site performance under heavy traffic by issuing
a large number of requests in a short period of time and collecting
reultant statistics. These data are important for many purposes, such
as sizing the service base, verifying and fine-tuning architectures,
and hosting contract fulfilment.

<p>
Load tests start with a design. The test designer analyzes the site,
anticipates common usage patterns and their probabilities, and creates
a user model, that is, a "virtual user" that emulates a person's actions.
The rest is to launch certain number of virtual users against the site
and collect data. Take <a href="http://www.amazon.com">amazon.com</a> as
an example. People do these on the site:

<ul>
<li> Browse various HTML pages
<li> Search and view different results
<li> Put an item into a shopping cart
<li> Check out the items; may go back shopping afterwards
<li> Login
<li> Register
<li> Write book reviews and feedbacks
</ul>

Each type of actions has a certain probability of happening. Site
like <i>amazon.com</i> is operational so you can get percentages from
the web log. To test a new web site yet to be launched, you will have
to make some educated guess and assign a probability to each task.

<p>
Some actions require a user session. For instance, check out requires
the user be logged in first. To emulate such a use case, it is better
record a real-person usage and then parametize the involved requests.
This is one of the major features of any load testing tools.

<p>
Once the "virtual user" is ready, the question is how to effectively
launch tens of thousands of them simultaneously against the server.
Launching all the test requires from a single machine is probably
unrealistic and inaccurate due to hardware and network limitations.
Therefore, it is a common practice to enlist a number of machines,
install agents on them, then have them fire test requests at a
synchronizing command. This is the second major features of load
testing tools.

<p>
Once the tests are done running, the collected data need be
consolidated from various test stations, and generate reasonable
reports. This completes a load testing run.

<p>
It is clear that a load test is none other than executing scripts.
Test scripts have to be designed and created. Those scripts are
typically written in proprietary languages, so knowledge about them
is useless outside the testing environment.

<p>
<em>JudoScript</em> has all the facilities to do effective web load testing, and
this is the topic of this article. We will see how to record
actions between web browsers and servers (including cookies); how
to use <em>JudoScript</em> threads to launch simultaneous requests to servers;
how to create test agents that run on various test stations to
synchronously fire test requests, and finally how to collect data
back to the master station for reporting. The end result is a
working skeleton that you can customize for your load testing needs.
