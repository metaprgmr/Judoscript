<h1>The Website of Judoscript.com</h1>

<p>There has been a website for the Judoscript language, <code>judoscript.com</code>, during its
lifetime. It has undergone a major change, so there was a <a href="judoscript.com-v1">version 1 site</a>
and a <a href="judoscript.com-v2">version 2 site</a>. Both these sites are, appropriately, rebuilt
for this museum.</p>

<p>The greater significance, however, lies in the fact that are both versions are built with
Judoscript programs, along with the software building process of the Judoscript language itself.</p>

<p>Version 1 was built purely with regular Judoscript programs.</p>

<p>Version 2 was built with the <i>JuSPT</i> technology. JuSP, which stands for <i><u>Ju</u>doscript
<u>S</u>erver <u>P</u>age</i>, is the counterpart to JSP, ASP, PHP, etc.; and JuSPT is short for
<i>JuSP Transform</i>, an offline technique to produce templatized dynamic document content. Since
JuSP did not reach its prime before the lifetime of Judoscript, its documentation scatchy; yet, the
programs that builds this version 2 proves its capability and stability.</p>
