# Building the Judoscript language and Judoscript.com</h1>

There has been a website for the Judoscript language, <code>judoscript.com</code>, during its lifetime. It has undergone a major change, so there was a [version 1 site](judoscript.com-v1)
and a [version 2 site](judoscript.com-v2). Both these sites are, appropriately, rebuilt
for this museum.

The greater significance, however, lies in the fact that are both versions are built with Judoscript programs, along with the software building process of the Judoscript language itself.

Version 1 was built purely with regular Judoscript programs.

Version 2 was built with the _JuSPT_ technology. _JuSP_, which stands for <u>Ju</u>doscript <u>S</u>erver <u>P</u>age, is the counterpart to JSP, ASP, PHP, etc.; and JuSPT is
short for <i>JuSP Transform</i>, an offline technique to produce templatized dynamic document content. Since JuSP did not reach its prime before the lifetime of Judoscript, its documentation scatchy;
yet, the programs that builds this version 2 proves its capability and stability.

Even though the Java source code was literally up to JDK 1.3 or 1.4, by very few tweaking (to avoid later Java keywords), it works surprisingly well with JDK 1.8, as demonstrated by this
reconstruction effort in setting up this museum. All the scripts have worked perfectly.
