# The _Judoscript_ Museum
This is the Museum for the **Judoscript** language.

Judoscript is a quite unique scripting language. It is the first (and possibly the only) multi-domain, general-purpose programming language; it was also one of the handful earliest Java scripting languages.

For a better understanding of Judoscript, please read this trio:
* [The Story and Philosophy of Judoscript](./story_philosophy.md)
* [Introduction to the Judoscript Language](./intro_to_judoscript.md)
* [Reflections on _the Judoscript Idea_](./judoscript_idea_reflections.md)

<img src="JianboHuang-small.png" align="right" border="0">Judoscript's journey started in late 2001, but sadly stopped short by the end of 2005. It was a work-in-progress without final fruition; yet, the language software was completed according to the desired plan. Even now, with Java versions having greatly advanced, it runs as smoothly as in 2005; what an unexpected delight! As life goes on, it is worth keeping its vestige in the digital ether. Hence, this museum is set up, not for the sake of immortality but, rather, in a sense of social responsibility.

This museum exhibits a rather complete setting for the Judoscript language development, its documentation building and website building. In other words, previously, the development bits and pieces were just sitting on my development machine, where only the source code and certain artifacts of the language were checked into _sourceforge_; but here, it contains both the source code and the build environment for the whole operation, so that, if someone is willing, he or she can [rebuild the language, as well as the website](./build_judoscript_website.md).

One of the reasons for doing this, as well as an interesting fact, is that all the build tools are _written in Judoscript_! This is the best way to showcase its capability and characteristics.

The website, whose content is built along with each release of the software for the shared documentation, has undergone one major change; hence there is a [version 1 site](./judoscript.com-v1/) and a [version 2 site](./judoscript.com-v2/); both are re-created and live, thanks to <u>github.io</u>.

Judoscript language was quite complete in terms of its implementation of funcionalities. However, due to its diverse nature, documentation and educational material takes vast amount of time to prepare. Therefore, up to its ending, it had always been work-in-progress, a fact that is reflected in the scatchiness of the website content. That has been the state of the website, and the best source of truth lies in examples/test cases.
