<h2>JSR 223 and Scripting Java</h2><font style="font-size:9px">By</font> <em>James Jianbo Huang</em></font> &nbsp; &nbsp;June 2003 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <img src="../share/printer.gif"> <a href="jsr223_p.html">printer-friendly version</a><p><b>Abstract</b> &nbsp;
This article tries to fathom what JSR 223 is and is about, discusses its potential benefits for
developers working in Java-related fields, and introduces an existing, related technology
called the Bean Scripting Framework (BSF).
<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>During JavaOne 2003, JSR 223 was filed and announced.
It caught the attention of many people because it is the first official mentioning of the term "scripting language" in the Java community.
This article intends to fathom what this JSR is about and how it can be good and important for the Java platform.
It also introduces the basics of a very close technology, BSF, and tries to bring up the similarities and differences between these two.
Since JSR 223 is just out and the original JSR document exclusively uses future tense, this article is by nature speculative to certain extent.
</p>


<h2><a name=whatisit>1. What Is JSR 223?</a></h2><p>

<p>JSR 223 is all about interaction and inter-operability between Java and scripting languages.
It is about using Java objects within scripting languages, and emphasizes on the situation of web applications.
The original motivation looks like accepting pages written in other (scripting) languages,
such as PHP, into the J2EE framework.
The result is unequivocally a standard API as a bridge between Java and scripting languages, that is,
to allow Java objects inter-operable within other scripting language engines.
For a comforming scripting language engine, Java objects will be accessible as if from a different container.
For web applications, it can be the Servlet container; for standalone applications, it can be an in-process JVM instance.
Theoretically, it can also be an out-of-process JVM, where Java objects can be retrieved via naming services such as JNDI.
For Java-based scripting languages, the Java objects may very well run in the same JVM as the language engine itself.
</p>

<p>The outcome of this JSR is expected to include the following:
<ul>
<li> A standard API between Java and conforming scripting languages,
     regardless of whether the scripting language engines are Java-based or not.
<li> A list of Servlet objects exposed to web pages written in non-Java languages.
     This part of the API is likely related to <code>javax.servlet</code>.
<li> A standard of packaging web pages in non-Java languages into a Java web application,
     the security, resource and class loader context issues,
     and possibly including the way to denote web pages written in non-Java languages
     within a Servlet container, such as tags in <code>web.xml</code> to designate a servlet
     for a certain kind of pages.
<li> The reference implementation will be built on top of the Servlet and JSP technologies
     for a number of scripting language bindings, where PHP is definitely included.
</ul>

</p>


 <p>&nbsp;<center>&#187;&#187;&#187; <a href=#top>Top</a>  &#171;&#171;&#171;</center><p>&nbsp;<p><h2><a name=why>2. How Is JSR 223 Good For Java And Computing In General?</a></h2><p>

<p>This JSR is good and important for both Java and general computing communities.
It acknowledges the increasing awareness of the usefulness of scripting languages for the Java platform,
and it will officially open the door of the Java world to other scripting languages.
This specification will benefit these two groups of audience: Java programmers and application developers.
More importantly, it will benefit Java technology to become a universal resource on all platforms.
</p>

<p>The Java platform is an incredibly rich cross-platform computing resource.
Its strong object-orientation makes itself a dream platform for scripting,
because one of the biggest advantages of object orientation is scriptability.
Java is readily usable for practical purposes through Java-capable scripting languages and/or interactive shells.
Many Java programmers are so happy coding in Java,
they have overlooked Java's tremendous power as a cross-platform <em>platform</em> and treat it just like another programming language.
With a standard API thanks to the effort of JSR 223,
many scripting languages will support Java scripting and be brought to Java programmers' attention.
This will extend Java beyond a mere system language for creating application software and become a readily useable platform,
so Java programmers can manipulate file systems and text files, run commands, process and analyze data in various formats,
prototype, develop, test, package and deploy Java software products, etc., all on top of Java.
</p>

<p>Application developers focus on rapid application development (RAD) to
cope with tight development cycles in order to fulfill ever-progressing business needs.
They tend to use "easier" languages such as scripting languages or even domain-specific declarative languages.
Those languages all have gateways to the underlying operating system or platform, so their capabilities are not limited.
For instance, Perl, Python and PHP all have large libraries available
that deal with every aspect of general computing and various areas.
In that sense, Java is the new kid on the block.
The standard packages in J2SE and J2EE are covering a lot of ground already,
and the explosion of Java open-source projects is providing more functional features to Java.
Exposure of this resource to scripting languages will greatly expand their horizon.
</p>

<p>This is especially true for web application development, which is actually the focus of JSR 223.
As we know, the J2EE platform has gained great momentum.
J2EE has created the most powerful and versatile middleware for web applications,
i.e., Java application servers such as Weblogic and WebSphere.
Through JSR 223, application developers can take advantage of J2EE platforms' resourcefulness using their favorate scripting languages.
</p>

<p>Java is a much easier language than C or C++.
While using the Java platform, application developers will be constantly exposed to Java, its environment, methodology and code,
and will have a good chance to move on to develop in Java to create reusable Java classes.
Compare this to the Windows platform, it would be much harder for Visual Basic developers to move on to creating COM objects in C++.
</p>

<p>On the other hand, more application developers developing on the Java platforms
will open up more opportunities for Java in the IT industry, helping Java to fight other monolithic technologies.
</p>


 <p>&nbsp;<center>&#187;&#187;&#187; <a href=#top>Top</a>  &#171;&#171;&#171;</center><p>&nbsp;<p><h2><a name=issues>3. Issues of Using Scripting Languages On Java Platform</a></h2><p>

<p>Application developers will have to make a choice when developing with Java.
Suppose a PHP developer is writing pages that run on a Java Servlet container, and she needs to do URL encoding and decoding.
Since PHP and J2EE both have APIs to do this, she needs to choose one and stick to that choice.
It would make sense to use the Java version for considerations such as performance if it is running on a Java app server.
However, if she feels there is a good chance to port the web application back to her home-grown Linux-Apache-PHP server,
PHP version is perferrable.
</p>

<p>Certain language communities are very loyal, and they may fear that Java would take over. This fear is not unfounded.
The truth is, Java is a superior technology, not just technically but also market-wise.
One may argue that his language is better for this or that minor reasons;
the fact is, Java is good enough in the very least, and is extremely popular.
There are web sites that rank programming languages, and Java is consistently among the top.
It is well worth joining the main stream of Java computing.
I would not, for instance, make the same recommendation if the main-stream programming language is C++.
</p>

<p>If Java platform becomes the basis for all scripting language, it can avoid a lot of wasted efforts in the computing communities.
For any particular features, open-source developers need just develop a Java version
rather than dialects for Perl, Python, Ruby, PHP, Tcl, ... and port them onto different platforms if they are written in C/C++.
JSR 223 is a big step towards this ideal.
</p>


 <p>&nbsp;<center>&#187;&#187;&#187; <a href=#top>Top</a>  &#171;&#171;&#171;</center><p>&nbsp;<p><h2><a name=bsf>4. The Bean Scripting Framework (BSF)</a></h2><p>

<p>JSR 223's opening statement of "bridge the scripting and the Java community" immediately reminds knowledgeable people of
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/bsf/index.html">BSF</a>.
BSF is an API designed exactly for this purpose.
BSF-enabled software, such as Ant, can use embedded scripts of any
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/bsf/projects.html">BSF-supporting languages</a>.
To have a scripting language embeddable in Java through BSF, it has to support this API.
At runtime, BSF the framework will function as a factory and load your language of choice.
The scripting language can be Java-based or not; if not Java-based, its BSF support will require native interface.
BSF was originally developed in IBM and donated to Apache Jakarta project.</p>

<p>What is even more interesting about BSF is, its JSP support is already there, in two ways! 
The first way is to <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/bsf/manual.html">to specify the
scripting language for the whole page</a> by putting such a tag

<pre>&lt;%page language="javascript" %></pre>

at the beginning of the page, and scriptlets enclosed between <code>&lt;%= %></code> and
<code>&lt;% %></code> are interpreted as JavaScript code, in this case. Of course, the
web application container has to be BSF-enabled and the scripting language engine registered.</p>

<p>The second way is to use the
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/taglibs/doc/bsf-doc/index.html">BSF tags in the JSP
Standard Tag Library (JSTL)</a>, also from the Apache Jakarta project, which consists of
two tags:

<pre>
&lt;bsf:expression language="perlscript">
  CreateBean("java.util.Date")
&lt;/bsf:expression>

&lt;bsf:scriptlet language="tcl">
  $out println "Hello world"
&lt;/bsf:scriptlet>
</pre>
</p>

<p>The nice thing is, JSP tags will all work. A corollary is, the compiled page remains
a Java servlet, and embedded scriptlets are passed to the language engine for evaluation.
This may work well in most situations but may encounter trouble for the following:

<pre>
&lt;ul>
&lt;%
   for (i=0; i<10; ++i)
   {
     %>&lt;li> Item #&lt;%= i %>&lt;%
   }
%>
&lt;/ul>
</pre>

This code snippet works for Java. For the JSTL-BSF tags, it would look like and
possibly cause syntax errors in the language engine:

<pre>
&lt;ul>
&lt;bsf:scriptlet language="...">
   for (i=0; i<10; ++i)
   {
&lt;/bsf:scriptlet>
&lt;li> Item #&lt;bsf:expression> i &lt;/bsf:expression>
&lt;bsf:scriptlet language="...">
   }
&lt;/bsf:scriptlet>
&lt;/ul>
</pre>
</p>

<p>The BSF Tag Library predefines these page objects for the scripting languages
to use:

<pre>
request
response
pageContext
application
out
config
page
exception
session
</pre>
</p>

<p>As we see, JSR 223 and BSF (including the BSF Tag Library for JSP) have a lot in common.
The difference seems to be that, BSF Tag Library is trying to enable scripting languages in JSP pages,
where JSR 223 is trying to include other scripting pages into J2EE web applications.
In other words, BSF Tag Library bridges scripting languages into JSPs;
JSR 223 bridges web application Java objects out to scripting languages.
The relationship between these two is interesting to watch.</p>


 <p>&nbsp;<center>&#187;&#187;&#187; <a href=#top>Top</a>  &#171;&#171;&#171;</center><p>&nbsp;<p><h2><a name=final>5. Final Words</a></h2><p>

<p>With a standard API and specification resulting from JSR 223,
Java and scripting language inter-operability will be standardized and popularized.
Web applications can be developed in pages not only with Java code but also with many "easier" scripting languages.
Non-Java application developers will have a chance to be exposed with Java technologies while developing in their favorate langauges,
and possibly upgrade themselves to Java programming.
Java programmers will be brought to the awareness of Java's resourcefulness, and think more about using Java beyond coding.
JSR 223 is a very important move for Java.
</p>

<p>There are existing technologies to enable Java in scripting languages and vice versa, such as BSF.
Many Java-based scripting languages provide <a href="embed.html">their own ways</a> as well.
JSR 223, being a standard for Java, should provide whatever is out there now and set a higher standard,
especially in the realm of J2EE.
