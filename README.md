# The _Judoscript_ Museum
This is the Museum for the Judoscript language.

Judoscript is a quite unique scripting language. It is the first (and possibly the only) multi-domain and general-purpose programming language; it was also one of the handful earliest Java scripting languages.

For its characteristics, the story, and reflections on the <i>Judoscript Idea</i>, please see [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judoscript).

Judoscript's journey started in late 2001, but sadly stopped short by the end of 2005. It was a work-in-progress without final fruition; however, the language software was completed according to the desired plan. As life goes on, it is worth keeping its vestige in the digital ether. Hence, this museum is set up, not for the sake of immortality but rather in a sense of social responsibility.

This museum exhibits a rather complete setting for the Judoscript language development, its documentation building and website building. In other words, previously the development bits and pieces were just sitting on my development machine, where only the source code and certain artifacts of the language were checked into sourceforge; but here, it contains both the source code and the build environment for the whole operation, so that, if someone is willing, he or she can rebuild the language, as well as the website.

One of the reason of doing this, as well as an interesting fact, is that all the build tools are [written in Judoscript](https://metaprgmr.github.io/Judoscript/website/)! This is the best way to show case its capability and characteristics.

The website, whose content is more or less built along with each release of the software for the shared documentation, has undergone one major change; hence there is a [version 1 site](https://metaprgmr.github.io/Judoscript/website/judoscript.com-v1/) and a [version 2 site](https://metaprgmr.github.io/Judoscript/website/judoscript.com-v2/); both are re-created and open, thanks to <u>github.io</u>.

Judoscript language was quite complete in terms of its implementation of funcionalities. However, due to its diverse nature, documentation and educational material takes vast amount of time to prepare. Therefore, up to its ending, it had always been work-in-progress, a fact that is reflected in the scatchiness of the website content. That has been the state of the website, and the best source of truth lies in examples/test cases.
