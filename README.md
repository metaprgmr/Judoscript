# The _Judoscript_ Museum
This is the Museum for the Judoscript language.

Judoscript is a quite unique scripting language. It is the first (and possibly the only) multi-domain and general-purpose programming language; it was also one of the handful earliest Java scripting languages.

For its characteristics as well as the story, please see [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judoscript).

Judoscript's journey started in late 2001, but sadly stopped short by the end of 2005. As life goes on, it is worth keeping its vestige in the digital ether. Hence, this museum is set up, not for the sake of immortality but rather in a sense of social responsibility.

This museum exhibits a rather complete setting for the Judoscript language development and its documentation and websites. In other words, previously the development bits and pieces were just sitting on my development machine, where the source code and certain artifacts were stored on sourceforge; but here, it contains both the source code and the build environment, so that, if someone is willing, he or she can rebuild the language, as well as the website.

One interesting fact is that, all the build tools are [written in Judoscript](https://metaprgmr.github.io/Judoscript/website/)! This is the best way to show case its capability and characteristics.

The website, whose content is more or less built along with each release of the software for the shared documentation, has undergone one major change; hence there is a [version 1 site](https://metaprgmr.github.io/Judoscript/website/judoscript.com-v1/) and a [version 2 site](https://metaprgmr.github.io/Judoscript/website/judoscript.com-v2/); both are re-created and open, thanks to <u>github.io</u>.

(More instructions will be provided for running the build processes later.)
