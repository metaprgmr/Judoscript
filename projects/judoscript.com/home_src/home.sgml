<u>For the real impatient</u>, the quickest way to get started is, as usual, the <a href="examples/index.html">example library</a> for all the language features. The <a href=articles/whitepaper.html>white paper</a> explains scripting in the Java era and <J> philosophy, and comprehensively introduces <J>. For <u>Java programmers</u>, <a href="books/judoscript-0.9/chapters/java.html">Java Scripting</a> may be more interesting. It is better to read <a href=newusers.html>For New Users</a> first because it introduces the very basics of <J>.
