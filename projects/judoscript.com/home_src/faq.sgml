<q id=diff>What is the difference between JudoScript and other scripting languages?
What is the compelling hook over others?</q>
<ans>
<p>JudoScript is as a potent programming and Java scripting language as any other Java-based scripting ones.
What differs it from others is, JudoScript has many built-in language constructs for popular application areas,
making their uses intuitive, natural and elegant.
See the <a href="articles/whitepaper.html#i_def">definition of scripting</a> to learn why JudoScript is so
different than programming languages that you are so familiar with.
With such a 3GL-4GL language design, JudoScript puts extraordinary emphasis on ease-of-use as well as ease-of-program.
</p>

<p>Take Python, a perfect example of traditional programming languages, especially so-called scripting
languages. It employs a small set of core language syntax and constructs, including a library mechanism
that allows users to extend functionalities of the language. A library is a collection of APIs that
application software are built upon. To ensure maximum reusablity and applicability, APIs are generally
low-level and detailed relative to the problem you are trying to solve. Such is the 3GL approach.</p>

<p>If 4GL is a new term to you, think about Unix shells. Unix shells are legitimate programming
languages, and has special commands that pertain to topics common to all Unix system users, such as
file system manipulation, process control, system configuration, etc. For instance, you use 'cp'
command to copy files, instead of coding a job-control-language (with APIs) to do the same.
JudoScript is the first and only Java-based scripting language that does all the above but extends its
reach into many of today's popular application fields, such as JDBC scritping, XML scripting, SGML
scraping, COM scripting, internet scripting, GUI scripting, etc. This is the compelling hook over
most other scripting languages.</p>
</ans>


<q id=jython>How does JudoScript compare to J/Python?</q>
<ans>
<p>Jython, BeanShell, Rhino, JudoScript and other Java-based scripting languages are all general-purpose programming languages
and are capable of scripting Java, despite their syntax differences.
On top of that, JudoScript also provides many application level scripting features <em>at the language level</em>,
so JudoScript supports object-level, OS-level and application-level scripting.
See the <a href="articles/whitepaper.html#i_def">definition of scripting</a> for a more meaningful comparison.</p>

<b>Thus, in terms of functionality, any of Jython, BeanShell, Rhino, ... at language level is strictly a subset of JudoScript.<b>
</p>

</ans>


<q id=learn>Is JudoScript hard to learn? Do I have to know Java?</q>
<ans>
<p>The core JudoScript language uses syntax and programming model similar to JavaScript.
Variables are not typed and no declaration is needed. Like any modern languages,
it adopts an object-oriented language design, every kind of value has a set of operations (methods).
JudoScript is <a href="ref/">well documented</a> with
<a href="examples/">ample examples</a> and
<a href="articles/">technical articles</a>.</p>
<p>You will need to know how to run Java software on your platform (Unix, Windows, ...) in
order to run JudoScript programs. For instance, if you want to use JDBC scripting to handle
data in an Oracle database, you will need to know how to add Oracle's JDBC driver into the
class path. JudoScript is a powerful scripting langauge itself and has many powerful
functionality to do most work.</p>
<p>One of JudoScript's key features is Java scripting. This is essentially designed for Java
programmers, but some times non-Java programmers may have to use Java as well. An example is
the Java byte array used in binary file read and write.</p>
<p>The recommended way to extend JudoScript is write Java code, although you can definitely
create JudoScript functions and classes to do the same. Writing Java extension library is
good because the same code can be shared by JudoScript and Java programs; they are typically
more performant and robust thanks to Java's strong-typedness.</p>
<p>In short, <u>Java knowledge is not required for end users, but is extremely important to
take full advantage of JudoScript</u>.</p>

<q id=learn_app>Is it hard to learn JudoScript's application features?</q>
<ans>
<p>How hard can it be to learn these?</p>

;</sample>

<p>Compare this to coding with <code>javax.mail.*</code> packages, especially if you don't
know how to program <code>javax.mail.*</code> yet.</p>

<sample>
do 'http://www.yahoo.com' as sgml
{
&lt;a>:    if $_.href { println $_.href; }
&lt;img>:  println $_.src; // $_ represents the current tag.
}</sample>

<p>This program prints out the URLs in &lt;a> and &lt;img> tags of an HTML page.
This is similar to XML SAX programming but is significantly more concise and elegant.
JudoScript supports XML SAX programming exactly the same way.</p>

<p>JudoScript application features are designed based on the needs of the topic; they
are natural and intuitive to the problem domain, and are easy to use and learn; this is
especially true when compared to their Java counterpart.</p>
</ans>


<q id=lgpl>What is the licensing term of JudoScript?</q>
<ans>
<p>LGPL. You are essentially free to do anything with the software and its source code.</p>
</ans>


<q id=notuse>When NOT to use JudoScript?</q>
<ans>
<p>Scripting languages are great for doing things quickly, or tasks that are simple,
straightforward and take frequently updates.
Scripting languages are not designed for building big software;
that is the job of <em>system languages</em> such as C, C++ or Java.
If a big software project is coded in a scripting language, you can pretty much assume it is still in prototype stage.
Why? because system languages have mechanisms that enable compilers enforce stringent rules so as to prevent many potential problems;
compilers can also optimize the final product to gain more performance.</p>
<p>JudoScript, being a pure scripting language, is no exception to this rule.</p>
</ans>


<q id=itsname>Why the name JudoScript?</q>
<ans>
<p>Better names are already taken. The name is chosen because a) it sounds ok, and b)
it starts with "J".</p>
</ans>


<q id=shtcmg>What are JudoScript's shortcomings?</q>
<ans>
<p>JudoScript is totally based on Sun's Java. Java implements the common denominator of
all supported platforms, and is not great to deal with popular platform features such
as 'chmod' on Unix. JudoScript tries hard to provide features on popular platforms by
working around Java's problems (for instance, 'chmod' and 'chown' are implemented for
Unix platforms, environment variables are handled, etc.), but there must be situations
where platform native code (through JNI) is needed. The classic example is COM scripting.
This does not necessarily break the "100% Pure Java"-ness of JudoScript, because such
features are declared to be optional. By the way, JudoScript never bothered to pass the
"100% Pure Java" test.</p>
</ans>


<q id=perf>What about JudoScript's Performance?</q>
<ans>
JudoScript's performance is surprisingly good, most probably thanks to the JVM JIT compilers.
The start-up is not that fast; on Windows 2000 and (slower) Linux machines,
small to medium size scripts take 2 to 4 seconds to begin executing.

</ans>


<q id=whyto>Why you created JudoScript?</q>
<ans>
<p>To use Java for <em>everything</em>, not just programming. Specifically,
<ol>
<li> to scripting Java,
<li> to scripting many tasks extremely easily, and
<li> to do these within an easy and powerful programming environment.
</ol>
</p>
</ans>


<q id=contrib>How can I contribute to JudoScript?</q>
<ans>
<p>If you create open source Java software, you are already contributing to JudoScript!
It would be even better if you license your software under LGPL or more open licensing
terms, so that JudoScript may provide native support for your package and include your
software in its distribution.</p>
<p>There are <a href="opensource.html">projects</a> that you
can help with.</p>
</ans>


<q id=embed>Is JudoScript embeddable in Java software?</q>
<ans>
<p>Yes, in one of the two ways:
<a href="ref/s.html?fa=java_judo_eng">its engine API</a> and
<a href="ref/s.html?fa=java_judo_bsf">its BSF support</a>.
</ans>


<q id=thrd>How to use threads in JudoScript? Can I use Java thread objects?</q>
<ans>
<p>JudoScript supports an easier 
<a href="ref/s.html?fa=lang_thrd">thread
programming model</a>. Since you can use any Java objects in JudoScript programs,
nothing prevents you from using <code>java.lang.Thread</code> objects, but this is
strongly discouraged.</p>
</ans>


<q id=jscls>Can I script Java classes of the JudoScript engine?</q>
<ans>
This is strongly discouraged except for the <code>com.judoscript.util.*</code> package and its sub-packages.
And their uses are not documented or guaranteed.
</ans>


<q id=natsup>What is <em>native support</em> in JudoScript? What is a non-native support then?</q>
<ans>
<p>A <em>native support in JudoScript</em> generally means specific syntax support in JudoScript,
sometimes it is just a built-in function. A "non-native" support for a Java software or feature
basically means you have to program using the Java APIs.</p>
</ans>

<category title="JudoScript Usage Questions">

<q>Are JudoScript's JDBC scripts cross-RDBMS's?</q>
<ans>
<p>This question is equivalent to "Is Java's JDBC cross-RDBMS's", because JudoScript does
not provide anything beyond what JDBC drivers provide. In other words, JudoScript passes
SQL and other parameters via JDBC API to the specific JDBC driver being used without further
filtering and interpretation.</p>
</ans>


<q>How to specify a (non-built-in) JDBC driver class?</q>
<ans>
<p>You can use the Java way of <code>Class.forName(jdbcDriverClassName)</code>, or specify
it as an attribute of "driver" in the <a href="ref/s.html?syn=ConnectStatement">database
connection statement</a>.</p>
</ans>


<q>How to copy multiple directories into a single ZIP file?</q>
<ans>
<p>Use <code>createJar()</code>, <code>createZip()</code> or <code>createTar()</code>
system functions to create a ZIP or tar archive, then use the
<a href="ref/s.html?syn=FSCopyStatement"><code>copy</code></a>
command for each directory into that archive before finally call the
<code>close()</code> method of the archive object to complete.</p>
</ans>


<q>How to serialize executable runs?</q>
<ans>
<p>By specifying a variable to receive the return value of the executable, you can effectively
serialize multiple executable runs.</p>
</ans>


<q>Can I use <em>my</em> Java classes? Do I have to specify my long Java class names everytime?</q>
<ans>
<p>Any Java classes can be used in JudoScript. Use the
<a href="ref/s.html?syn=JavaClassShortcuts">Java package name shortcut</a>
mechanism to make it easier to use if your Java class names have long package names.</p>
</ans>


<q url="articles/java_excpt.html#extend">Can I use a Java interface? How?</q>
<ans>
<p>See <a href="articles/java_excpt.html#extend">here</a>.</p>
</ans>


<q url="/articles/java_excpt.html#extend">Can I extend and use a Java abstract class and interfaces? How?</q>
<ans>
<p>See <a href="articles/java_excpt.html#extend">here</a>.</p>
</ans>


<q>How to use Java static members and methods?</q>
<ans>
<p>Use <code>::</code> between the Java class name and the static method or member
name to use them. Or, If a static Java method is repeatedly used, can use the
<a href="ref/s.html?syn=StaticJavaFunctionDeclaration">static
Java method alias</a> mechanism to make them look like regular JudoScript functions.</p>
</ans>


<q>What is the easiest way to read a text file, line-by-line?</q>
<ans>
<p>Use the <a href="ref/s.html?syn=LinesStatement"><code>do ... as lines {}</code></a> statement.</p>
</ans>


<q id=template>Is JudoScript good for templates?</q>
<ans>
You have two ways to create a templating system in JudoScript,
<ol>
<li> For simple text replacement, use the <a href="ref/s.html?syn=LinesStatement"><code>do ... as lines {}</code></a> statement.
<li> You can define your own SGML format with tags, case-sensitively or insensitively, and eaily create processing software with
     the <a href="ref/s.html?syn=SgmlStatement"><code>do ... as sgml {}</code></a> statement.
</ol>

Another convenience is the <a href="ref/s.html?fa=localdata">Local Data</a> mechanism, that you can attach a template right
at the end of the script.
