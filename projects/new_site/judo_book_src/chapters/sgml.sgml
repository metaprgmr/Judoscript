<synopsis>
<J> includes a built-in SGML parser and provides the <kw>do</kw> .. <kw>as</kw> <kw>sgml</kw> and <kw>do</kw> .. <kw>as</kw> <kw>jsp</kw> event-driven statements that are very handy for scraping HTML and JSP pages, build custom SGML sublanguages and set up template systems. Each tag is denoted as an event, and you as a programmer provides code for each tag. The tags also include <kw>TEXT</kw> and special tags such as <kw>&lt;!></kw>, etc. In the handler code, the <code>$_</code> variable will hold the tag object, which may have attributes. SGML (including XML) documents are great to separate content and their presentation, and the <J> SGML statement is a very convenient way to implement SGML document transformers.
