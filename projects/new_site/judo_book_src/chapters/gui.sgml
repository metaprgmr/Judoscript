<synopsis>
One of the uses of <J>'s Java scripting is to build Java GUI programs, either AWT, Swing or SWT based. In addition to the Java-only way to build Java GUIs, <J> provides a special GUI event handling statement, <kw>guiEvent</kw>, that is an event-driven statement. An event from a GUI component is denoted as a colon-separated tuple, and you as a programmer supply the handling code. The event object is stored in the <code>$_</code> variable, which is of different type depending on the event.
