<a name=install><h2>Install and Run</h2></a>

<p>
Now that you are reading this page, you have successfully obtained the
software and have it unpacked. Check the following list before run any
JudoScript programs:
<ol>
<li> Your JVM version is JDK 1.3 or equivalent or highter.
<li> Put file <code>judo.jar</code> in your JVM's class path.
<li> If you intend to use JDBC, make sure the JDBC driver classes for
     your database is in the class path.
<li> If you intend to use XML features, make sure a Java XML parser is
     in the class path. We recommend Apache Xerces parser, available 
     from <a href=http://www.apache.org>Apache's site</a>. For JDK 1.4
     users, a XML parser is already included; Xerces may still be
     preferrable for advanced XML features. Just make sure Xerces class
     files are before JDK classes.
<li> If you intend to send e-mail, make sure <code>javax.mail.*</code>
     classes are in your class path. The JavaMail package can be
     downloaded from <a href=http://java.sun.com>JavaSoft's site</a>.
     It is also part of J2EE.
<li> If you intend to use <a href=doc/articles/http_html.html#jusp>JUSP</a>
     to develop web sites, register the servlet class
     <code>wws.judo.jusp.JuspServlet</code> to your servlet engine and
     provide a <code>juspRoot</code> init parameter that serves as the
     root directory for all JUSP pages. If it is not specified, JUSP
     pages are resolved the same way as other web pages.

<a name=relnote><h2>Release Notes</h2></a>

<p>
This is an early access release for <em>JudoScript</em>. The
<a href=doc/langspec/spectoc.html>Language Specification</a> has
listed all the features implemented so far. Some features are listed
without details; they are planned for later releases; there is no
guarantee, though. Features that are finished or nearly finalized
are explained in the <a href=doc/articles/intro.html>articles</a>. 

<p>
In this release, the language engine and Java gateway are considered
completed; language definition may undergo changes based on user
feedback but is expected to be minor. Most general-purpose and
enterprise functionalities are in. JDBC scripting has been tested
mostly for basic database operations; advanced data types and
scrollable cursors are not supported as yet. XML scripting supports
SAX and DOM programming; other XML processing activities can be
achieved by using Java.

<p>
Since this is a rather early access release, some obvious language
features are not in yet, such as precompiled programs or even
byte-code generation. Error handling is fairy rudimental, that is,
parsing errors and runtime errors may look very different because
the former is generated by JavaCC. This will be customized later.
Line numbers reported in included files may not be accurate. All
these will be collectively addressed in error handling clean-up.

<p>
<em>JudoScript</em> has so many features that make it a legitimate
shell. The current release is more of a language engine; commands
will be introduced along with a shell facility. The language
engine can be customized by a startup script. These are part of a
to-do list.

The following is a list of changes in addition to internal bug fixes
and enhancements:

<ol>
<li> <a href=http://www-124.ibm.com/developerworks/projects/bsf>Bean
     Scripting Framework</a> support.
<li> Bug fix: XML packages are mandatory, not optional.
</ol>

<a name=doc><h2>Documentation and Examples</h2></a>

<p>
Documentation includes a
<a href=doc/langspec/spectoc.html>language specification</a>
that describes each feature precisely and a set of
<a href=doc/articles/intro.html>articles</a> discussing
major features with a lot of code examples. The source code
of the formal code listings are all included in the
<a href=examples/index.html>examples</a> directory.

<p>
A handful of Java source files concerning HTTP cookies are
derived from Apache Tomcat project; they are in a different
Java package, so name clashes is prevented. This also serves
the purpose of fulfilling the licence requirement of using
these source files.

<p>
Some of the examples are ported from Java programs in Java
tutorials from JavaSoft. You may download the Java source
from <a href=java.sun.com>Sun</a>.
