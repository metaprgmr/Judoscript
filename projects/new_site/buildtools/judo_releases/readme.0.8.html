<a name=install><h2>Install and Run</h2></a>

<p>
Now that you are reading this page, you have successfully obtained the software and
have it unpacked. Check the following list before run any JudoScript programs:
<ol>
<li> Your JVM version is JDK 1.3 or equivalent or highter.
<li> Put file <code>judo.jar</code> in your JVM's class path.
<li> If you intend to use JDBC, make sure the JDBC driver classes for your database
     is in the class path.
<li> If you intend to use XML features, make sure a Java XML parser is in the class
     path. We recommend Apache Xerces parser, available from
     <a href=http://www.apache.org>Apache's site</a>. For JDK 1.4 users, a XML
     parser is already included; Xerces may still be preferrable for advanced XML
     features. Just make sure Xerces class files are before JDK classes.
<li> If you intend to send e-mail, make sure <code>javax.mail.*</code> classes are
     in your class path. The JavaMail package can be downloaded from
     <a href=http://java.sun.com>JavaSoft's site</a>. It is also part of J2EE.
<li> If you intend to use <a href=doc/articles/http_html.html#jusp>JUSP</a> to
     develop web sites, register the servlet class
     <code>wws.judo.jusp.JuspServlet</code> to your servlet engine and provide a
     <code>juspRoot</code> init parameter that serves as the root directory for all
     JUSP pages. If it is not specified, JUSP pages are resolved the same way as
     other web pages.
<li> To use the SSH and SCP features, <a href=http://www.isnetworks.com/ssh>the
     MindTerm/SSH package</a> must be downloaded and installed.
<li> To use the Windows registry support, download Tim Endres'
     <a href=http://www.trustice.com>JNI Registry Library</a>.
</ol>

<p>
<em>JudoScript</em> version 0.8 has a few <a href=#changes>exciting new features</a>.

<p><hr>

<a name=changes><h2>Changes</h2></a>

<p>
Changes for <em>0.8</em>:

<ol>
<li> <em>JudoScript</em> supports
     <a href="http://www.judoscript.com/ref/index.html?l=_synn.html&r=synn_JavaExtensionDefinition.html">Java
     extension classes</a>, that is, you can extend Java classes and interfaces.
     Because of this, the embedded Java class and adapter mechanisms are deprecated.
<li> <em>JudoScript</em> supports variables embedded inside string literals with <code><b>${</b><i>Xyz</i><b>}</b></code>.
     They can be used individually as well. If a variable named <i>Xyz</i> exists, its value is taken,
     otherwise, the environment variable with that name, if exists, is retrieved. There are also a number
     of predefined shortcuts, such as <code>${~}</code> for home directory, <code>${.}</code> for the
     current directory, <code>${:}</code> for path separator and <code>${/}</code> for file separator.
<li> <em>JudoScript</em> now uses an easy way to consistently document scripts with its
     <a href="http://www.judoscript.com/ref/index.html?l=_synn.html&r=synn_UsageDeclaration.html">usage</a>
     mechanism.
</ol>

<p>
Changes for <em>0.7</em>:

<ol>
<li> Documentation has been completely re-written, accompanying the overall code
     review and functionality finalization. There are still a few areas need be
     finished, but it is much better than the older version under the title Language
     Specification.
<li> Variable names no longer need to start with <code>$</code>! Dollar signs in
     variable names make an immeidate false impression that <em>JudoScript</em> is
     somewhat like some archaic language, which is unfortunate. However, it does
     segregate the name spaces for variables, object data members and function names.
     Now that dollar sign is not required to start variable names, they all fall in
     the same name space and can potentially clash. This causes two problems in terms
     of the syntax:
     <ul>
     <li> Class data member and variables:
<pre>
class Foo {
  function bar { aData = 'abcde'; }
}</pre>
          Is <code>aData</code> a local variable or a data member of class <code>Foo</code>?
          It is resolved to be a variable if already exists (not available in this example),
          or a data member if the variable did not exist but the data member does, or as a
          new variable if not variable nor data member exist at the moment. To ensure it is
          a data member, use the <code>this</code> modifier to reference a data member
          inside a class method: <code>this.aData = 'abcde'; </code>
     <li> Function variables. In the case of <code>a()</code>, say, it is not clear whether
          <code>a</code> is a function name or a variable that holds a reference to a
          function. <em>JudoScript</em> chooses to interpret it as a function name. To
          invoke a function reference, use this new notation: <code>a-&gt;()</code>. This
          applies to class data members as well: <code>obj.a-&gt;()</code>, whereas
          <code>obj.a()</code> invokes the object's method. If the function reference is
          stored in an array, however, this notation is not needed: <code>arr[i]()</code>.
     </ul>
<li> Changed the way static Java member usage, e.g.<br>
     <code>java.lang.System::out.println('hello');</code>
<li> Changed function alias declarations for Java static methods, e.g.<br>
     <code>function rt for <code>java.lang.Runtime::getRuntime();</code>
<li> Added "sgml" as a synonym to "html".
<li> Added "do ... as lines" statement.
<li> String contains() method also works with regex's.
<li> Added "hsqldb" and "pointbase" to the known JDBC driver list.
<li> Added &lt;!--&gt; as a separate case than &lt;!&gt;; &lt;!&gt; includes
     &lt;!--&gt; only if the latter is not handled.
<li> UserDefined, added method "copy(UserDefined)".
<li> Added isA() method to all value objects.
<li> Added "isOdd" and "isEven" user methods to values.
<li> Added "fmt/formatRoman" and "parseIntRoman" user methods to numeric values.
<li> Added "isAlpha/isLetter", "isAlnum/isLetterOrDigit" and
     "isWhite/isWhitespace" user methods to character values.
<li> Added "exists" user methods to array.
<li> Added "createTreeOutput" system method.
<li> Added "ear" and "war" in addition to "jar" for FS commands.
</ol>

<p>
Changes for <em>0.6</em>:

<ol>
<li> Changed package names to <code>com.judoscript.*</code>. This affects BSF and embedded engine.
<li> Modified syntax error message, so it does not print out a long list of "expected symbols".
</ol>

<p>
Changes for <em>0.5</em>:

<ol>
<li> Open source!
<li> Added <b>transform</b> clause for the <b>copy</b> command.
<li> Provides a console debugger. This is rudimental, and is more or less a
     reference for a more robust, GUI-based debugger.
<li> Provides the Java file white-box testing feature.
</ol>

<p>
Changes for <em>pre.0.4</em>:

<ol>
<li> Added support for generic Java package lists; the built-in package
     lists have become aliases using this feature.
<li> Added support for conditional include and const definitions.
<li> Added support for initialization script, ".judoscript".
<li> Added countLines option to list/ls commands.
<li> Added support for SSH and SCP (requires ISNetworks distribution of
     MindTerm/SCP version 1.2.1 SCP Release 3).
<li> Added support for encryption (requires JCE1.2.1; in JDK1.4 already).
<li> Added support for XSLT (requires Xalan/Xerces).
<li> Added support for Windows registry (requires Tim Endres' JNI Registry Library at
     http://www.trustice.com).
<li> Added support for Unix syslog (uses Jef Poskanzer's Acme package class).
</ol>

<p>
Changes for <em>pre.0.3</em>:

<ol>
<li> Added regular expression support (requires JDK1.4).
<li> Added TAR file support -- use just like ZIP/JAR.
<li> Added chown/chgrp/chmod commands.
<li> Added database table dumping feature.
<li> Added better database meta data support.
<li> Added tableData data structure.
<li> Added printTable statement for tabular data printing.
<li> Added evalFile statement (in addition to eval and evalExternal).
<li> For JDBC, allow PreparedStatement and ResultSet methods to be
     called directly. These can be RDBMS-specific.
<li> Added FTP support (uses the Java FTP Client Library from
     http://www.enterprisedt.com).
</ol>

<p>
Changes for <em>pre.0.2</em>:

<ol>
<li> <a href=http://www-124.ibm.com/developerworks/projects/bsf>Bean
     Scripting Framework</a> support.
<li> Bug fix: XML packages should not be mandatory but optional.
</ol>

A handful of Java source files concerning HTTP cookies are derived from
Apache Tomcat project; they are in a different Java package, so name
clashes is prevented. This also serves the purpose of fulfilling the
licence requirement of using such source files.

<p>
Some of the examples are ported from Java programs in Java tutorials from
JavaSoft. You may download the Java source from <a href=java.sun.com>Sun</a>.

<p>
JudoScript bundles some other software packages are either public domain
without licensing restrictions or under the same license for this software
(i.e., LGPL). Their package names are <em>usually</em> changed so that no
conflicts would occur should a user machine have another version of the same
software available in the class path. Their source code is included in the
source code distribution of this software. The following is a descriptiong
of these.

<p>
The Microsoft COM support is by <a href="http://www.hcn.zaq.ne.jp/no-ji/jcom/">JCom package</a>
by Yoshinori Watanabe. It is included verbatim.

<p>
The TAR support of JudoScript uses classes developed and contributed to the
public domain by Timothy Gerard Endres. Many thanks for his wonderful work!

<p>
The Unix syslog feature is included from <a href="http://www.acme.com/java/">ACME Labs</a>

<p>
An FTP client is included (but not documented and used). This software is
