<J> allows seamless Java code invocation, hence is perfect for Java code white-box unit
testing. The language engine explicitly supports this by allowing <J> code to be
embedded in (the comments in) Java source files. Special tags enclose <J> code, and
the engine extract and run them. <J> is also great for batch black-box and load testing.

<p>
<J> has two characteristics that make it an ideal testing language especially for
Java software. They are a) seamlessly invoking Java code and b) rich application
features. If you go through its readily available feature list, plus the potential to
use <em>any</em> Java software as its extension libraries, you will find why <J> is a
powerful batch black-box and load testing language.

<p>
This article focuses on <J>'s white-box testing capability for Java. It has a feature
that is designed especifically for this purpose -- embedded <J> code. It is like
<a href=http_html.html#jusp>JUSP</a>, except that this is not for generating web pages
but rather embedding scripts in Java source files. It is very simple to use. In the
Java source file, use a pair of special tags, <kw>/*[judo]</kw> and <kw>[judo]*/</kw>,
to enclose any <J> code; you can have unlimited such <J> code segments. Then, simply
"run" that Java source file with <J>:

<demo>
java judo Foo.java
</demo>

the language engine will extract all the <J> code and run. The following is the source code:

<codelist name="white-box testing" caption="Foo.java">
public class Foo
{ 
   /*[judo] 
     function ut_sum { 
       println 'UnitTest: int sum(int[])'; 
       x = javanew Foo; 
       ia = javanew int[] { 1, 3, 5 }; 
       println 'Is this 9? -- ', x.sum(ia); 
       println 'For null -- ', x.sum(null); 
     catch: 
       $_.printStackTrace(); 
     } 
   [judo]*/ 
   public int sum(int[] ia) { 
     int sum=0; 
     for (int i=0; i&lt;ia.length; i++) sum += ia[i]; 
     return sum; 
   } 
} 
/*[judo] 
   println '[UnitTest: class Foo]'; 
   ut_sum(); 
   println '[/UnitTest]'; 
[judo]*/ 
</codelist>

<p>This incredibaly simple scheme is incredibly effective and efficient.
It is better than Java unit testing with Java code for these reasons:

<ul>
<li> <em>Simple, straightforward, concise</em>. No need to adopt frameworks to create
     a multitude of test classes (in Java) for testing.  No house-keeping code.
<li> <em>Easy to run and maintain</em>. No need to compile. Just modify and run.
<li> <em>Easy to organize test cases</em>. With the help of <kw>!include</kw>,
     you can use common testing libararies and/or testing-time parameters.
<li> <J>'s rich application features help in white-box tests, too. Tests typically
     need to set up environment; <J> is designed to manipulate computer resources
     including data. Java is a system language, calling APIs to set up is not a
     pleasant task for most programmers.
</ul>

<p>
JudoScript source code itself uses embedded JudoScript code. In file <em>MethodOrdinals.java</em>,
JudoScript code is used to detect ambiguous or replicated function ordinals. In file
<em>VariableAdapter.java</em>, JudoScript code tests the basic methods used by all the value
types.
