&lt;body>&lt;h1>Embed JudoScript In Java&lt;/h1>

Two ways to embed &lt;em>JudoScript&lt;/em> in Java: through its support of Bean Scripting
Framework and its own, simpler engine interface. &lt;em>JudoScript&lt;/em> is designed for
Java, using Java is intrinsic. The only issue regarding embedding in
Java is passing Java objects between Java code and the script. IBM's
Bean Scripting Framework (BSF) is a popular interface for this purpose.
It also supports event handling of beans by scripts, a feature not needed
here. BSF support is significant because there are Java applications, such
as Ant, use this bridge to embed a number of BSF-supporting scripting
languages. However, if you intend to use just &lt;em>JudoScript&lt;/em> for your embedded
scripting needs, &lt;em>JudoScript&lt;/em> has a simpler and lighter-weight interface. You don't
need any extra packages (BSF, that is). You can also parse a script and
run in multiple engines in their own Java threads.
