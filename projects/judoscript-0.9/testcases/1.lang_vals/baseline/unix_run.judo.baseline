  #!/usr/bin/env judo

look familiar? It does do what you would expect.

In JudoScript, there are 4 forms of comments:

  /* ....
     .... multi-line comment
  */

  /? ....
     .... multi-line comment
     -- recommended used rarely, only to disable a block of code.
  ?/

  // .... single-line comment

  #! .... yet another single-line comment!

The last form is designed for auto-run scripts on Unix.
