Title: Creating J2EE Clients
Product: Weblogic Server 7.0/6.1
Audience: Advanced Dvelopers/Administrators
Synopsis: J2EE is a platform for the web applications. Its
many services, however, are not limited to web clients.
WLS implements most services specified in J2EE, many of
which can be invoked to support sophisticated distributed
architectures. J2EE clients are mostly Java programs. But
writing clients in Java is tedious and less efficient.
Java-based scripting languages can do a much better job.
We use a sample e-commerce web site to demonstrate how
various J2EE clients can be used for business logic and
system monitoring. The clients are written in JudoScript,
a scripting language designed for J2SE and J2EE.
