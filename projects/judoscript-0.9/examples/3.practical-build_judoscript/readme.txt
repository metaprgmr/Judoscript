                     Build JudoScript


Before building, download the source file (src.jar) and
perhaps the pre-generated java files (generated.jar),
unpack them into a location.

The build.judo script compiles and packs JudoScript. It
takes targets to compile individual or all features, and
pack the compiled files into jar files. Run it without
parameters to see its usage, or simply view it.

The buildenv.judi is included by build.judo. It sets a
number of variables that are used in the build process.
The included one is an example; see the values of those
variables and install needed tools and Java packages.
They are all available via the internet; do a Google
search to find their locations.
