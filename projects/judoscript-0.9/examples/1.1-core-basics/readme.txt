                         JudoScript Language Basics


Like any general-purpose programming language, JudoScript has its own support
of value types, variables, expressions, flow control, etc. This directory
holds examples that demonstrates all the language basics.

The 'lang' directory contains examples show the basic language features of
variable, expressions, statements, functions, function variables, user-defined
classes and simple data types.

The 'datastruct' directory demonstrates JudoScript's readily usable,
sophisticated data structures, some of them are extensible by user.
JudoScript's strong programmability owes largely to its wealth of built-in
data structures.

The 'eval' directory shows JudoScript's dynamic evaluation feature, common in
scripting languages.

The 'thread' directory shows the language's thread programming support. It is
native and natural, easier and more intuitive than Java's thread programming
model.
