                    Java Scripting with JudoScript


JudoScript's Java scripting support is robust and powerful. It is also
extremely important, as Java is the recommended way to build libraries for
JudoScript (indeed for Java). All the Java scripting capabilities are
demonstrated in this directory.

You can use Java objects like any other objects in JudoScript, once they are
instantiated. Java arrays can be used in the same homogeneous way. Java
static methods can called, and can be aliased so that they can appear like
a regular JudoScript function. They are ways to make it easier to use Java
class with package names.

Java classes can be extended in JudoScript, and Java interfaces can be
implemented in the same way; such classes are called "Java extension
classes", and they are genuine Java classes generated on the fly but is
coded in JudoScript.

More Java scripting examples are available in 'JavaGUI' (under 'apps'), as
Java GUI programs all use AWT and Swing classes.
