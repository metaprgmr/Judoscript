<a name=install><h2>Install and Run</h2></a>

<p>
Now that you are reading this page, you have successfully obtained the
software and have it unpacked. Check the following list before run any
JudoScript programs:
<ol>
<li> Your JVM version is JDK 1.3 or equivalent or highter.
<li> Put file <code>judo.jar</code> in your JVM's class path.
<li> If you intend to use JDBC, make sure the JDBC driver classes for
     your database is in the class path.
<li> If you intend to use XML features, make sure a Java XML parser is
     in the class path. We recommend Apache Xerces parser, available 
     from <a href=http://www.apache.org>Apache's site</a>. For JDK 1.4
     users, a XML parser is already included; Xerces may still be
     preferrable for advanced XML features. Just make sure Xerces class
     files are before JDK classes.
<li> If you intend to send e-mail, make sure <code>javax.mail.*</code>
     classes are in your class path. The JavaMail package can be
     downloaded from <a href=http://java.sun.com>JavaSoft's site</a>.
     It is also part of J2EE.
<li> If you intend to use <a href=doc/articles/http_html.html#jusp>JUSP</a>
     to develop web sites, register the servlet class
     <code>wws.judo.jusp.JuspServlet</code> to your servlet engine and
     provide a <code>juspRoot</code> init parameter that serves as the
     root directory for all JUSP pages. If it is not specified, JUSP
     pages are resolved the same way as other web pages.
<li> To use the SSH and SCP features, <a href=http://www.isnetworks.com/ssh>the
     MindTerm/SSH package</a> must be downloaded and installed.
<li> To use the Windows registry support, download Tim Endres'
     <a href=http://www.trustice.com>JNI Registry Library</a>.
</ol>

<a name=relnote><h2>Release Notes</h2></a>

<p>
<em>JudoScript</em> is open source! The language is almost finalized,
although there are still major (but not critical) application features
need be implemented. If you are interested in helping, click
<a href=http://www.judoscript.com/opensource.html>this link</a> for a
list of projects currently open. There is still a lot of work for the
tools, such as the language engine, precompiling, error handling, etc.

<p>
The <a href=doc/langspec/spectoc.html>Language Specification</a>
lists all the languages features. The <a href=doc/articles/intro.html>articles</a> 
explain major topics in detail.


<p><hr>

<a name=changes><h2>Changes</h2></a>

<p>
Changes for <em>0.6</em>:

<ol>
<li> Changed package names to <code>com.judoscript.*</code>. This affects BSF and embedded engine.
<li> Modified syntax error message, so it does not print out a long list of "expected symbols".
</ol>

<p>
Changes for <em>0.5</em>:

<ol>
<li> Open source!
<li> Added <b>transform</b> clause for the <b>copy</b> command.
<li> Provides a console debugger. This is rudimental, and is more or less a
     reference for a more robust, GUI-based debugger.
<li> Provides the Java file white-box testing feature.
</ol>

<p>
Changes for <em>pre.0.4</em>:

<ol>
<li> Added support for generic Java package lists; the built-in package
     lists have become aliases using this feature.
<li> Added support for conditional include and const definitions.
<li> Added support for initialization script, ".judoscript".
<li> Added countLines option to list/ls commands.
<li> Added support for SSH and SCP (requires ISNetworks distribution of
     MindTerm/SCP version 1.2.1 SCP Release 3).
<li> Added support for encryption (requires JCE1.2.1; in JDK1.4 already).
<li> Added support for XSLT (requires Xalan/Xerces).
<li> Added support for Windows registry (requires Tim Endres' JNI Registry Library at
     http://www.trustice.com).
<li> Added support for Unix syslog (uses Jef Poskanzer's Acme package class).
</ol>

<p>
Changes for <em>pre.0.3</em>:

<ol>
<li> Added regular expression support (requires JDK1.4).
<li> Added TAR file support -- use just like ZIP/JAR.
<li> Added chown/chgrp/chmod commands.
<li> Added database table dumping feature.
<li> Added better database meta data support.
<li> Added tableData data structure.
<li> Added printTable statement for tabular data printing.
<li> Added evalFile statement (in addition to eval and evalExternal).
<li> For JDBC, allow PreparedStatement and ResultSet methods to be
     called directly. These can be RDBMS-specific.
<li> Added FTP support (uses the Java FTP Client Library from
     http://www.enterprisedt.com).
</ol>

<p>
Changes for <em>pre.0.2</em>:

<ol>
<li> <a href=http://www-124.ibm.com/developerworks/projects/bsf>Bean
     Scripting Framework</a> support.
<li> Bug fix: XML packages should not be mandatory but optional.
</ol>

<a name=doc><h2>Documentation and Examples</h2></a>

<p>
Documentation includes a <a href=doc/langspec/spectoc.html>language specification</a>

a lot of code examples. The source code of the formal code listings are all
included in the <a href=examples/index.html>examples</a> directory.

A handful of Java source files concerning HTTP cookies are derived
from Apache Tomcat project; they are in a different Java package, so
name clashes is prevented. This also serves the purpose of fulfilling
the licence requirement of using such source files.

Some of the examples are ported from Java programs in Java tutorials
from JavaSoft. You may download the Java source from

The TAR support of JudoScript uses classes developed and contributed
to the public domain by Timothy Gerard Endres. Many thanks for his
wonderful work!

<p>
The bundled software are either public domain without licensing
restrictions or under the same license for this software (i.e., LGPL).
Their package names are changed so that no conflicts would occur
should a user machine have another version of the same software
available in the class path. Their source code is included in the
source code distribution of this software.
