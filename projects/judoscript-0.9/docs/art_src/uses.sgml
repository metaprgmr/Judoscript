<abstract>
<J> is an agglomeration of numerous useful mechanisms on top of a
general-purpose programming language with seamless Java support. It is
built to help minute-to-minute, day-to-day and even night-to-night
computing for individuals and enterprises. We present some of its uses
just to give you some concrete ideas. Scripting languages are good for
some tasks and not-so-good for others. We discuss a few scenarios where
<J> is most appropriate for MIS, software development and business
services, and some quick tricks that everybody can take advantage of.
</abstract>
</doc>


<p>
<J> is a general-purpose programming language, with many built-in
features and subsystems that can be readily used for tasks big and small.
Since it is built on and for the Java platform, it is naturally
cross-platform. Because of its strong support for Java classes, moving
functionality between scripts and Java code is smooth and flexible. 

<p>
Scripting languages have their own uses. Developing full-blown software
is not one of them. If a piece of software is developed mainly in some
scripting language, chances are, it is still at prototyping stage. <J>
is ideal for many aspects of business applications and software
product/service development tasks like prototyping, automated testing,
background jobs, cross-database transfers, multi-format data aggregation
and processing, data archiving and backups, on-line system monitoring,
etc. It also has so many niceties that everyone can take advantage of
on a regular basis for personal needs, one-time tasks, basic utilities,
on-the-fly tests, quick database queries and fixes, impromtu reporting
and formatting, calculators ...

<p>
In some cases, this article presents source code as examples, assuming
you are a guru in <J>. If you don't feel that way yet, please refer to
the respective articles for details.



<section name=dataproc>

<section name="xdb">

<p>
<J> is ideal for cross-database data transfer and transformation, data
mining and reporting, because it is designed to be a JDBC scripting
language. From JDBC's point of view, all the supported databases are
equal. <J> is a general-purpose programming language, too, so
complicated computations and transformations can be done effectively.
Such tasks can be run as a job with the <kw>schedule</kw> command,
which is remotely manageable via a HTTP interface.



<section name="xfmt">

<p>
<J> is ideal for processing, reporting and exchanging data from
multiple sources in multiple formats of XML, HTML, text documents
and databases. Data may be obtained from databases, web sites and
other data and service providers. Such tasks can be run as scheduled
jobs or passively initiated.


<section name="arch">

<p>
<J>'s multi-source file compressing and archiving features coupled
with JDBC scripting makes it great for automated data backup and
archiving processes. Such tasks can be run as scheduled jobs or
activated by human operators.


<section name=dev>

<section name="eng">

<p>
Animation and screenplay-like software such as games, educational,
simulation and electronic arts all have vast number of variations
occurring around a growing set of predefined graphical or conceptual
elements. The key is dynamic-ness. <J> is a superb glue language to
serve as a controlling agent for such systems. Its capabilities of
seamless Java interaction, thread programming, scheduled events,
dynamic code execution, networking, database interaction and
document processing are all important requirements for such systems,
and they are presented in an easy-to-use fashion, meeting the needs
of frequent modifications and continued evolution. Performance is
not an issue because the percentage of CPU time spent on controller
is very small, where the bulk of CPU time is probably used by
graphical engines and/or special-purpose inference engines, which
may be written in Java or native code or even as device drivers.



<section name="prot">

<p>
<J> is perfect for Java software idea prototyping, be it a web-, GUI-,
XML-, database- or network-based appplication or a combination of
these, because it is not only a modern general-purpose programming
language natively supporting all these features plus threads, but also
extremely Java friendly. With <J>, prototypes are fast to develop and
easy to modify and adapt. Front-end to back-end, online servers to
background jobs, database creation to data management, test data
loading to use case emulation, <J> has means to satisfy most if not
all. As the object-oriented analysis and design process goes round and
round, more and more subsystems, that is, objects or clusters of
objects, start to emerge. The prototype may continue to server as a
test bed, allowing pieces of software components to evolve. Over time,
some pieces of the prototype may even stay with the production system,
such as database creation and management scripts, background jobs that
does asynchronous data processing and/or transaction processing, etc.,
and other scripts may become the core of the test suite.



<section name="qa">

<p>
<J> is ideal for testing software and services, especially
coordinated and automated tests.

<p>
<incap>Unit Tests</incap> Java classes, transactions, use cases, 
enterprise Java beans, work flows, private network protocols, ...
these can be tested easily with <J>'s Java, JDBC and other
capabilities.

<p>
<incap>Load Tests</incap> <J> supports thread and HTTP client and
server programming. These are invaluable for load testing web sites.
The HTTP client can save and load cookies. One scenario would be,
declare a thread that emulates the whole process of a user session
with random delays and a number of usage paths; for one test instance,
fire up certain number of such threads at once. This script can be
run from multiple machines; to synchronize the tests to emulate
larger number of simultaneous users, create a mini HTTP server in
each script, and have a "master" script send a start command to
them around the same time.

<p>
<incap>Automated Testing</incap> In software development, any changes
can introduce new features, desired or not. To ensure the software
behave as wanted, complete test coverage should be done as much as
possible. The majority of test cases would pass, only the failed few
should be examined and identified. <J> has <kw>assert()</kw> and
exception catching capability. You can resume execution after an
exception. Automated tests are highly feasible and easy to implement.
With a fully automated test suite, you would expect to either see a
"success" messsage at the end or a handful of errors, where the
tester will review and verify.


<section name="pkg">

<p>
<J> has strong support for manipulating files, directories and zip
archives. It can run executables, too. When a product is ready to
ship, a <J> can pick the right files and directories, create
appropriate zip or jar files, generate last-minute information, and
build a shipping package. Similarly, installation process can be
automated, so that the package can be installed on any
<J>/Java enabled machines.


<section name="doc">

<p>
<J> is a data processing language. It processes textual documents
from XML, HTML to text files, and interacts with database through
JDBC. This is great for automated document processing and management,
especially in a team environment of technical development. For
instance, one can write a Java parser (using tools like JavaCC), and
turn all the Java source files into a DOM-like tree; once this is
done, you can use <J> to navigate, query or associate pieces of Java
classes with any specific documents. Another example is, define a few
special tags and use them in the HTML documentation, and have a few
<J> programs process them into real HTML pages (kind of server-side
stylesheet), and collect all the information to generate catelogs,
references, code listings, figure listings, table of contents, etc.;
this is exactly how <J> documents (including this article) were prepared.




<section name=online>

<section name="job">

<p>
E-commerce and other web-based customer services have a lot going
on behind the scene. For instance, in order to maintain a good
response time to users in front of browsers for complicated
transactions, a commonly used model is to quickly accept user's
input, process it in the background, and send the result to the
user via e-mail. <J> is design with this kind of tasks in mind,
with features like <kw>schedule</kw> statement, sending e-mails,
database interaction, EJB container interaction, HTTP connection
and general networking, file system operations, flexible native
program execution and even password protection. The centerpiece is
the <kw>schedule</kw> statement. It schedules events at fixed rate
or at absolute moments, and also has a built-in HTTP server that
administrators can remotely view the job status and/or control
various aspects of the job itself.



<section name="mon">

<p>
As the cliche goes, a picture is worth a thousand words; this can not
be more true for monitoring and configuration tasks. In addition to all
the good things mentioned earlier, <J> is also a Java GUI language,
easy to implement AWT and Swing GUIs; it is also a HTTP server language,
equally capable of creating web UIs. (You can create a multi-threaded
web server with less than 80 characters, seriously.)



<section name=quick>

<p>
There are many features in <J> you can take advantage of to make your
everyday life easy. First let us review how to run <J> programs.

<p>
<J> programs are usually put in text files typically with extension
".judo". To run, first make sure <J> and supporting Java class libraries
(such as JDBC drivers and your own Java class files) are in the
classpath. JDK1.3 and up is required. Issue a command line like this:

<demo>
%java judo foo.judo parm1 parm2 /option1=val1 /option2
</demo>

Command line "java judo -x" will take the first parameter as a program
(the rest of the parameters become its parameters), like this:

<demo>
%java judo -x "ls '*.jud*' except '*/alfa*,*/test*' recursive noHidden"
</demo>

You can do a lot with a short program like this. I create short aliases
to make using them easier: <kw>j</kw> or <kw>j.bat</kw>, for <u>java
judo</u>. <kw>jx</kw> or <kw>jx.bat</kw>, for <u>java judo -x</u>.

<demo>
%jx "copy '*.jud*,*.java' except '*/alfa*,*/test*'
     recursive noHidden echo to 'arch.zip';"
%jx ". getFileContent('servlets.properties');"
</demo>

In the second line, the dot command is a shortcut for <kw>println</kw>.
You will see a lot of it.



<section name=clock>

<p>
Time zone conversion and listing all the time zone IDs:

<demo>
%jx ". date().fmtDate(null,'Asia/Shanghai');"
%jx "for x in (javaclass java.util.TimeZone).getAvailableIDs() { . x; }"
</demo>

Find out the day of week for a date, the date after so many days and
the number of days between two dates:

<demo>
%jx ". date(2012,1,1).fmtDate('EEEE');"
%jx "d=date(2001,10,25); d.date+=10; . d;"
%jx ". (date(2012,1,1).int() - date(2001,10,25).int())/(24*3600000);"
</demo>


<section name="listcopy">

<p>
Search for files:

<demo>
%jx "ls '*.judo,*.java' in 'c:\\temp' except '*/alfa*' recursive;"
%jx "ls '*.judo,*.java' in 'save.zip' except '*/alfa*' recursive;"
%jx "list 'save/*' recursive size;  . $$fs_result;"
%jx "list 'save/*' recursive count; . $$fs_result;"
</demo>

Find files and do something with them:

<demo>
list '*.jud*, *.java' in 'dev/' recursive noHidden;
for $x in $$fs_result {
  $f = openTextFile($x);
  . $f.readLine();
  $f.close();
}
</demo>

Copy files to another directory or a zip file:

<demo>
%jx "copy '*.htm*,*.gif,*.jp*,*.css' in '~/devroot/'
     recursive noHidden echo to '/sys/docroot/';"
%jx "copy '*.htm*,*.gif,*.jp*,*.css' in '~/devroot/'
     recursive noHidden echo to '~/save.zip';"
</demo>

Remove a directory:

<demo>
jx "rmdir 'c:/test force;"
</demo>

Save multiple trees into a single zip file:

<demo>
$zip = createZip('save.zip');
copy '*.htm*,*.gif,*.jp*,*.css' in '~/docroot/'
     recursive noHidden echo to $zip;
copy '*.jud*,*.java' except '*/alfa*' in '~/devroot/'
     recursive noHidden echo to $zip;
$zip.close();
</demo>

Download a file:

<demo>
%jx "copyStreams openFile('http://www.xxxx.com/cesoir.mp3'),
     openFile('cesoir.mp3','w');"
</demo>


<section name="file">

<p>
Create and write to files:

<demo>
$file = openTextFile('foo.txt','w'); // create
println <$file> 'Hello, World!';
$file.close();

$file = openTextFile('foo.txt','a'); // append
println <$file> 'Again Hello, World!';
$file.close();

$file = openGZippedTextFile('foo.txt.gz','w');
println <$file> 'Hello, New World!';
$file.close();
</demo>

<p>
Read from files and process text:

<demo>
$file = openGZippedTextFile('data.txt.gz');
while ($line = $file.readLine()) != eof {
  $dat = $line.csv(',');
  . $dat[0]:<10, $dat[1]:5.2, $dat[2]:>10;
}
$file.close();
</demo>

Sort a file:

<demo>
arr = [];
file = openTextFile('FountainValley.java');
while (line = file.readLine()) != eof { arr.append($line); }
file.close();
arr.sort();
for x in arr { . x; }
